# 💛_ You're Not Alone  
**Alone at your desk, together in code.**

**You're Not Alone** is a VS Code extension designed to let developers around the world quietly say,  
_"Hey, I'm here too."_  
No followers, no metrics—just the comfort of knowing other developers are coding alongside you, right now.

## ✨ How It Works

- 🟢 **Check In**  
  Simply use the form at the bottom of the primary sidebar panel, or use the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) to quickly check in. There's a 10-minute cooldown between check-ins to keep things genuine.

- 💬 **Add a Check-in Message (Optional)**  
  Include a short message ("What's on your mind?") of up to 42 characters to let others know how you're feeling or what you're working on.

- 🧑‍💻 **Automatic Tech Stack Detection**  
  Your tech tags are automatically identified based on the last three files you've opened. The supported file extensions are:

```
jsx → react  
tsx → react, typescript  
vue → vue  
svelte → svelte  
ts → typescript  
py → python  
rb → ruby  
php → php  
go → golang  
rs → rust  
java → java  
cs → csharp, dotnet  
fs → fsharp, dotnet  
sql → database, sql  
dart → flutter, dart  
kt → kotlin  
swift → swift, ios  
scala → scala  
clj → clojure  
elm → elm  
ex → elixir  
hs → haskell  
r → r  
toml, yaml, yml → configuration  
json → json  
md → markdown  
html → html  
css → css  
scss → scss, css  
less → less, css
```

- 🔒 **Privacy First**  
  **You're Not Alone** does **not** read or access any of your actual code or editor contents. The extension only detects file extensions from filenames you've recently opened.
